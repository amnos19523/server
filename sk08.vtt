WEBVTT

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.730
She was always...

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.190
Kato had always...

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.450
"Friday"

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.430
Okay, ready to go to our team meeting, Kato?

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.850
It seems like you completely fell for it,
I was only pretending to sleep.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.150
You say that, but you were actually
sleeping, weren't you, Aki?

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.940
I really was only going to pretend to sleep at first!

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.340
Add color to the monotony of every day

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.180
Like the gentle breeze blowing by

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.270
I'm sure this miracle of meeting you that day

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.280
Will shine a light on my tomorrow

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.780
Even my moments of weakness

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.200
I believe can move someone's heart

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.500
Beyond that sky over there

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.930
I believe the world I imagined is out there

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.220
I open my heart like a window

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.190
I want to learn even more about you

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.360
Because I have been with you more than anyone

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.990
How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend Flat

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.330
AUDIOVISUAL ROOM

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.080
What about Eriri and Kasumigaoka-Senpai?

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.080
I told you, they aren't coming today!

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.250
The Girl Who Didn't Break the Flag

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.670
-Did you?
-Now, come with me!

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.340
We're going to actually use the AV room?

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.430
Yes, you'll see why soon.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.730
Aki?

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.910
I actually planned to print this out on paper,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.290
but my printer ran out of ink.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.960
I should have known.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.550
In other words, depicting some rawness
in the heroines,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.680
having them express complex emotions
and shifts in attitudes,

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.520
is the crux of how you create a fictional character
you can truly fall in love with.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.060
I see.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.110
The game I originally planned at the start

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.190
was about bringing the heroine's charms
to the surface.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.620
My plan was to make a main heroine
that would make your heart race.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.280
Really?

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.080
But what we ended up with was something
completely different from the original plan.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.040
It was an epic, emotional romance.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.500
Of course, I was happy with the new direction.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.420
And with the talents of Utaha-Senpai and Eriri,

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.720
the game ended up becoming a success.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.180
It's just...

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.640
Could I ask you something?

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.220
What is it, Kato?

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.640
What are these documents, exactly?

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.270
Kato, did you skip the title of the first page?

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.270
I don't mean that.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.530
This is obviously the proposal for our next game!

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.360
Why are you showing this to me?

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.790
Kato! Are you just skimming the proposal
I poured my heart and soul into?

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.660
It's because this game's main heroine
will also be Meguri Kanou!

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.500
You know, the character based on you!

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.880
Do you really think I would be happy
to participate in this project?

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.630
I don't know. I really don't.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.720
But if you don't come aboard,
this project will never come together.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.470
Even if everyone else joins,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.850
without you, this game can't be made.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.820
I don't think you need to be so
adamant about that.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.450
Being the model for your main heroine
isn't much of a role.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.120
What does it even mean?

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.580
I have my regrets.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.500
We had the best team members,
and we made the best game.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.830
Everyone did a spectacular job.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.420
Eriri, Utaha-Senpai, Michiru,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.840
and also you.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.800
Everyone continued to give it their all
until the very end.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.010
That's right. Everyone worked hard.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.010
So I don't need to do any more.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.600
There's no reason to keep going.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.440
But I still haven't taken you to that place.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.480
That place?

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.150
The place beyond where our hard work took us.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.860
A place you feel happy from the bottom of your heart.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.450
So I'm a little sad about that.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.870
I've come down from the initial excitement.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.620
Because I was the only one who didn't give it their all.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.250
I gave up running at the very end,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.540
and just stood still.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.210
That's why I want a second chance!

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.130
This time, I won't wake you from your dream!

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.510
I will let you finish the race running!

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.180
I will make it so you won't want to quit
being a game maker or geek!

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.560
That's right, being the main heroine was just a ploy.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.930
Just a good excuse!

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.810
But this time, I just want to be able
to celebrate with you!

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.900
In that case,

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.610
I have no other choice but to make a proposal
that you can't help but want to join!

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.160
Then why

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.910
would you go with a proposal
filled with your cringey fantasies?

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.250
Is this really what you think
I would want to participate in?

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.760
This will revolutionize the dating sim genre!
Only I could make this happen!

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.680
Really?

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.970
I think what you want to do is pretty common.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.680
Did you actually read the proposal
I poured my blood into?

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.980
The crux of this proposal is
to take what everyone's thought of

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.190
and to combine it with the ideas nobody has ever--

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.570
That's it, Aki.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.020
That's what, Kato?

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.950
You want to make a game
on that scale with this staff?

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.120
PLANNING: AKI TOMOYA

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.700
It looks like there's one person who is doing
the planning, writing, and directing.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.210
Is that just my imagination?

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.590
Don't worry, I will have you assist the person
planning and directing the game.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.710
What? I don't want to do all that work.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.260
There's no room for complaints when we're trying
to revolutionize the dating sim genre!

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.430
Aki...

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.300
Please, Kato.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.470
Please, just one more time.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.940
Be my main heroine as well as
my second in command!

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.020
I want you to carry this Dōjin Team with me!

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.120
Could you clear one thing up for me?

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.580
Yes.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.330
Have you told Eriri that you are
making me the main heroine again?

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.670
Not yet.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.670
Do you think that's okay?

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.500
Can you really make this decision without telling Eriri?

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.380
Look, Kato,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.930
I am going to ask you this very tentatively.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.100
But is the reason why you've been mad at me

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.180
because Eriri and I have gotten close lately

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.600
and you have some feelings about that?

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.650
It's not some messy situation
like you might find in a dating sim, is it?

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.410
What are you talking about, Aki?

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.960
Right? I didn't think so!

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.340
What? Did you think that I liked you or something?

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.510
Have you forgotten all the things you've done to me?

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.130
But, you know, it happens a lot in dating sims!

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.300
Heroines who just fall for you even though
you haven't done anything to deserve it!

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.640
That's probably because people like you
who don't know the real world

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.060
are making those types of games.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.560
Okay! I get it! I was stupid! Please forgive me!

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:14.070
I mean, what else am I supposed to do
when you say something ridiculous?

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.990
Really, I'm sorry, Kato.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.830
It's fine. I just want to erase that from my memory.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.710
No, not that. I mean about last year.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.960
Last year?

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.000
I'm sorry I didn't come talk to you.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.130
I'm sorry I didn't reach out.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.380
I'm sorry for failing you

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.090
as a friend.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.340
That's...

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.010
But thank you.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.890
I'm so happy now.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.060
Why?

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.440
Because you love Blessing Software
even more than I do!

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.770
You loved it so much, you couldn't forgive me
for giving up on the Winter Comiket!

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.570
The thought of that just makes me so happy!

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.360
I'm about to burst!

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.870
But at the same time, I feel so bad for failing you.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.210
Thank you, Kato.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.920
What are you...?

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.130
What are you...?

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.720
What are you talking about?

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.350
Thank you.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.390
Thank you, Kato.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.690
And also,

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.940
I'm sorry.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.150
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:38.820
I'm sorry.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.860
I'm sorry.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.540
Aki, you know,

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.370
I've had to hold it in all this time.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.540
I'm sorry.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.210
You can throw your apologies around all you want,

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.840
it's not making me feel any better.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.220
Oh, right.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.470
What are you smiling about?

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:05.640
That just makes me even more mad.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.100
We're friends, aren't we?

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.150
Eriri, Kasumigaoka-Senpai, and Ms. Hyodo too.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.900
Yeah, also me.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:24.450
If we're friends, then there shouldn't be any secrets,
or hidden feelings, or decisions made behind our backs!

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:30.500
Shouldn't we be able to talk to each other
about the things troubling us?

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.710
You're right.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.330
I was wrong.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.550
It was fun for me.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.720
The Dōjin Team was a lot more fun
than I thought it would be.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.880
Kato...

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:47.640
That's why being away from you
and everyone these past two months

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.310
has been really hard.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.390
I'm sorry.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.890
I told you.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.730
Your apologies sound cheap.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.490
Do you really think this new arrangement will work?

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:10.740
Well, it might be hard at first, but if we just
take it slow and get used to things...

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:17.000
I still don't think an amateur like me
could be the team's second in command.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.000
Especially when every other member
is so impressive.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.010
Don't worry!
Besides, your leader isn't anyone special.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.010
Oh, sorry. Could you grab that onion?

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.640
Why an onion?

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.770
I was thinking about making curry for dinner.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.480
You're going to cook dinner?

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.520
Because I figured our meeting tonight
is going to run long.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.280
You think it's going to go long?

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:47.240
Which means you're only going to ask
Kasumigaoka-Senpai to write the main route?

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.910
Yeah, since Utaha-Senpai just started university.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.410
She also has her new novel she's busy with.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.210
Even though you pushed
a whole game on her last year

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.510
when she was busy with her
university entrance exams and novel?

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.220
But even if it were just one route,

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.720
I have high expectations that it
will be her greatest work!

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.060
But if the rest of the script
is going to be done by you,

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.100
then won't there be a big difference in quality?

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.480
We have to be looking forward!

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.690
Well, I suppose we'll just need our leader
to do his best.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.820
All right, I'm going to go pay for these now.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.030
Lend me some clothes to wear later, okay?

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.530
You're just fully intending on spending the night?

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:35.620
So is Eriri still in a slump?

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:41.880
Yeah, so it might be hard to ask her
to do the art for all the characters.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.420
But even if we were to add another artist,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.760
they would have to be as good as Eriri,

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.470
and not already affiliated with any Dōjin Team.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.930
Is there someone you know
who fits that description you could ask?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:59.350
Thank you for pointing out our harsh reality.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.810
Where are your parents today?

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.820
They're actually in Nagano for a memorial service.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.490
They won't be back for two days.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.950
Oh, this again.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.080
Pardon me.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.080
You really aren't worried about anything, are you?

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.000
Like I said before,

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:25.250
our Cherry Blessing
did end up becoming a great game.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.050
But it wasn't the game I planned to make.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.140
It wasn't like my game idea
was what made it great.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:36.470
Well, you pretty much got carried by
Kasumigaoka-Senpai and Eriri.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.850
That's why our next project needs to get back to
Blessing Software's original vision.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.030
A game that draws people in
without any gimmicks.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.190
Really?

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.280
More character-driven than our last game,

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.110
but you would still be moved
by the simple story.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.580
We'll grab the players with your true charms--

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.620
How's this?

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.790
Seems good to me.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.590
It's just that games that focus
on communicating with the heroines,

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.340
tend to rely heavily on a system.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.350
Needing to manage the protagonist's
health and schedule,

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.100
getting three options for date locations and gifts,

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.850
pressing the screen to kissy kissy with the girls.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.230
Really? That's great.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.610
Yes, games like that are great.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:31.150
But I want to make a story-centric
adventure game instead.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.700
I'm thinking that would be the Tomoya Aki brand.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.080
What do you think, Kato?

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.950
I don't know.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.500
Come on, this is important!

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:43.460
I mean, I love stories about the girls I love!

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:48.250
You really don't feel embarrassed when it comes
to the two-dimensional, do you, Aki?

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.880
Anyway, just listen to me for now.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.050
Okay, okay.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.760
Yes, this is hard.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.430
It might turn out worse than our previous game.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.180
It might not even sell.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:59.810
Fans may flame it.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.770
But still, I--

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:03.890
You had some on your face.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:13.030
-This is what the game would be like.
-You mean, just a regular school dating sim?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.700
Yes. No past memories. No incurable illnesses.
No time travel.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.620
No cheap alternate universes either.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.960
We'll simply offer ordinary conversations,
small events, and the cuteness of our heroines.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.170
But that's pretty much what they do with this game.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.300
No, there's something
this game falls short in for me.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.800
Two things, in fact.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.300
Really?

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.220
One is the day-to-day conversations.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.350
The conversation scenes between the heroine
and player account for most of the game,

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.310
but it's incredibly boring and cringe-worthy
and utterly indefensible.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.150
We'll have to be careful about that.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.020
The second is the heroine's reaction.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.860
It's way too one-dimensional.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.700
Tsundere, younger sister, older sister,
they all follow the tired templates.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.120
But I thought templates were important.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.200
Yes, they're important. Really important.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.330
But, Kato, heroines are people too.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.040
Depending on the time they've spent with you
and the mood they're in,

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.290
it's natural their reaction would change.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.340
Attitudes change when feelings develop.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.130
The way you talk with old friends
changes too.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.970
And very subtly and in steps.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.010
Yes, they can't change abruptly either.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.930
If they do, the player will be taken out of it.
That's why it must be gradual.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:26.890
By depicting these heroines as human
through variation, we can...

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.060
Kato?

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.730
Aki...

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.190
Could you sit over there a second?

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.690
I'm already sitting down.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.030
You're right, Aki. Human relationships change.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.450
That's right.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.660
Depending on the time spent together
and their changing feelings,

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.170
I think they need to change their
attitudes and actions to reflect that.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:55.050
Yet I don't understand why your attitude
didn't change at Winter Comiket.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.050
If you knew all this,
why couldn't you do that for me?

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.510
Have we not gotten close?

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.140
I thought you already forgave me for that.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.520
I realized you didn't understand
anything at all,

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.390
which made me mad all over again!

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.150
Wait, let's calm down, Kato!

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.860
You said the game's heroines were human,
didn't you?

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.780
That's right. That's exactly right.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.410
I'm human just like the main heroine.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.700
Oh, I'm starting to cry again.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.620
By the way, what is with this title
How to Raise a Boring Heroine?

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.920
I know you've told me
multiple times how bland I was,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.790
but I never thought you'd make it the title!

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.880
I can change it if you don't like it!

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.420
You know,

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.680
you can't even read my reactions.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.310
Do you really think you have what it takes
to make such a delicate game?

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:47.890
Well, that's...

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.440
I can only say that I'll do my best.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.360
Never mind your effort, I think you just lack
the fundamental sensitivity.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.320
I'm studying what I can.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:05.080
Aren't you in some way trying to do something
even more difficult from our last game?

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.580
More importantly, Kato...

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.950
What is it?

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.120
You're taking a bath so you can relax.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.840
Instead of scolding me, why don't you
just sit back and enjoy your bath?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.960
Be quiet.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.510
Whose fault do you think this is anyway?

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.680
I'm sorry.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.720
I told you your apologies sound cheap today!

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:27.930
I'm sorry.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:34.310
It's not that I really wanted to bring my phone
into the bath with me!

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.990
So, what is going to happen now?

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.490
I guess I'll need to start by trying to get
the other members onboard.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:49.450
Do you think Kasumigaoka-Senpai
will still work with us after she graduates?

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.620
I guess all I can do is express my sincerity to her.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:55.210
Does that mean
confessing your feelings for her?

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.380
Please go to sleep, Ms. Kato.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:02.130
And how are you going to address
Eriri's slump?

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.220
That...

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:07.260
We may just have to wait that one out.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.270
Do you really think all she needs is time?

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:16.230
I don't know, but I don't know
what else to do either.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.650
Should you be this focused on me
when you haven't figured anything out yet?

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.820
Just go to sleep.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.490
Don't blame me for whatever happens, Aki.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.910
Then what should I do, then?

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.660
I don't know either.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.000
Honestly.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.750
You're all over the place today, Kato.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.380
You're right.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.590
Hey, Aki.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:40.750
What is it?

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.170
When tomorrow comes,

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.760
I want you to forget how I was today.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.260
Yeah, I know.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.810
But I won't.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.430
Oh, I almost forgot.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.310
What is it now?

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.110
Here, Aki.

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.690
It's obviously obligatory, but here you go anyway.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.530
Well, thanks.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.820
Okay, I'll really go to sleep now.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.410
Okay.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.130
-Good night.
-Good night.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:36.520
The miracle on the hill, my heart raced

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:42.900
My story began that day

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:49.070
I was on the sidelines, having nothing special at all

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.740
But I somehow got the courage

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.170
Success doesn't matter

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.130
If it's only a game

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.550
Get back to those lacking days

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.760
Don't worry about talent or context

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.930
Even the boring days are reality

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:20.020
Please! Please! Don't stop!
A rhapsody to cheer me on

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:26.490
To an unknown world
Because you pull me forward by the hand

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:32.700
Even the coldness of every day
Is starting to look brighter

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:38.660
I want to become the heroine
I have real dreams now

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:42.830
